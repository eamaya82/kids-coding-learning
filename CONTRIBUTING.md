### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: new functionality or add something else, you want to do something that is not implemented
- **qa-needed**: if you did something and it works, but you're not sure if it's okay that way
- **documentation-needed**: if you do not find a guide, examples or a tutorial on how to do something, this is the way to let us know
- **bug-high-priority**: a problem that prevents it from working or represents a problem that affects significantly
- **bug-low-priority**: the problem is passable, it is presented very rarely or it does not represent an impediment in the functionality but it would be good to solve it
- **help-wanted**: if you have problems implementing something either because you are new / inexperienced, you do not know how to do it or because as it is supposed to work it does not

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
